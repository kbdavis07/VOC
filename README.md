##A Dictionary for Job Titles / Positions and Skills##

Job titles in today's world can vary greatly from one company to another and there needs to be a way to have job titles that means the same to all companies and people.




## Codification of Job Titles  ##

There needs to be a way to have shorter job titles and one way is with codification.  This allows Employers, Employees, and Job Seekers to all share a common Job Title that means exactly the same to everyone.

Codification also allows much easier search functions when using the internet, the Voc website or even Twitter.



##Example of Codification in the Works##

**`WAD0X0M` = Web Application Developer Asp.Net MVC**


WAD = Web application Developer

0 = Separator

X = Asp.Net

M = Model View Controller (MVC)



## Usage Examples ##


**Google Search Query**:  "*WADOXOM Remote*" 

Returns Web Application Developer Asp.Net MVC job listings that offers remote and also job seekers wanting or willing to work remote.


**Twitter as an Hash Tag:**  #WADOXOM  



## Full Syntax: ##

Title-Platform-Language-Pattern-Side-SkillLevel


*Note: "0" is used to separate the different fields.*


WAD0X0CS0M-1   =  Web Application Developer Asp.Net C# MVC Skill Level = 1


With Codification reduces the Job Position or Title from around 55 characters including spaces to 12 characters in total.


The level of details can go very specific to general depending on the need at the time.

Looking for just Asp.Net Web Application developers which could include developers that uses the following: 

Web Forms, MVC, Visual Basic, or C# 

Would use the following:

**WAD0X**


To filter it out to only those that uses C# would be:

**WAD0X0CS**


This way Codification allows easy filtering with just the Job Position/Title code without requiring any special querying terms like:

"Web Application Developer C# -Visual Basic "

This is solved with the Job Code of : **WAD0X0CS**
 

If wanted only those that uses or knows Visual Basic would be:  **WAD0X0VB**



## Attempts at job title "Classification" ##

Standard Occupational Classification

**15-1134 Web Developers Internet Application Developer**


[http://www.bls.gov/soc/soc_2010_direct_match_title_file.pdf](http://www.bls.gov/soc/soc_2010_direct_match_title_file.pdf "Standard Occupational Classification")

Uses just numbers which is not human friendly.  One would have to look up the codes each time they want to search for a job title, job, or resume.

Our attempt is to make it human friendly that is easy to create on demand.


**15-1134 Web Developers Internet Application Developer**


Would become:  WAD   = Web Application Developer

The Numbers 15-1134 tells us nothing and requires look up to figure out what it is on both ends the person writing it and the person reading it.


Another issue is that the Standard Occupational Classification is done by the government and anything done by the government is going to be slow and not uptodate.

Last Modified Date: March 11, 2010

A lot of things have changed in 5 years and not updating it since 2010 is not acceptable.

The VOC system will have a "living" dictionary of Job Titles and Skills that are updated in real time as they change.


## Goal for the VOC system is to have it Crowd Powered that is current in real time 24/7/365. ##


Will have a Feedback section at the bottom of each title for comments on what needs to be changed and etc, and after review by consensus of a vote determines exactly what a specific job title should be at that specific time.
